# Tiered classification of flag state registries by sanctions evasion risk.
# Sources: Paris MOU grey/black lists, OFAC advisories, KSE Institute,
# CREA shadow fleet reports, Windward research.
#
# tier_0: Registries with no effective maritime administration or known
#         to issue documents without verification. Vessels flagged here
#         are almost certainly engaged in sanctions evasion.
# tier_1: High-risk registries with documented shadow fleet connections,
#         weak oversight, or frequent flag-of-convenience abuse.
# tier_2_monitored: Major open registries with generally adequate oversight
#         but known to host shadow fleet vessels. Flag alone is not a signal;
#         combined with other indicators it becomes relevant.
