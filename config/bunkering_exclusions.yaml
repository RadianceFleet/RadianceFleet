# Known bunkering vessels to exclude from STS transfer detection.
# These are legitimate fuel supply vessels that operate in close proximity
# to tankers in anchorage areas (especially Fujairah, Singapore, Gibraltar).
# Without this exclusion list, every bunkering operation triggers a false STS alert.
#
# Sources: MPA Singapore licensed bunker suppliers, Fujairah port authority,
# Gibraltar Port Authority, EMSA bunker vessel registry.
#
# Maintenance: Update via CLI or manual edit. MMSI is the primary key.
# Set excluded: false to re-include a vessel.
